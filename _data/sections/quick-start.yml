  This is a set of instructions covering the entire CRS workflow. These are not
  step by step instructions; more detailed instructions with illustrations are
  provided later in the Detailed Usage sections.


  ## Step One: Create a new client


  From the Home View you can locate an existing client, or, choose to create a
  new client.

  ## Step Two: Create an evaluation


  When you view a new client, there will be no evaluations in the evaluation
  screen. You must create one with the New Evaluation button.

  ## Step Three: Add notes to the Basic Info section of the evaluation


  Each evaluation has several tabs worth of data (see tabs below header). On the
  Basic Info tab, you can set an external work order ID, and enter some general
  notes regarding the client.

  ## Step Five: Record Measurements


  {Measurements can be taken within the scan by selecting "measure" and adding
  the chosen measurements or by navigating to the measurement tab of the
  evaluation.} In order to start a new measurement you can press the "Add
  measurement" button and a new blank measurement will be added to your list.
  First Select the dropdown list to identify which measurement you plan on
  using. In order to interactively edit the measurement press the "Ruler"
  button. You will be given an option of "Point to Point" or "Orthographic" to
  choose which method you would like to measure with.


  Within an evaluation, navigate to the measurements tab to start recording
  measurements.  Users have the option to have digital measurements added (from
  an existing scan) or to enter measurements that have previously been taken.


  "Point to Point" allows you to select points directly on the 3D model.
  "Orthographic" allows you to select anywhere on the screen.


  Select a start point on the 3D model and then select an end point on the
  model. You should see 3 control points show up along with a red line going
  through them. You can grab any of these points to do more fine tuning.

  ## Step Six: Capture images and video


  On the Attachments tab you can upload images, video, and files to the
  evaluation by clicking on the corresponding icon.  Pressing the "camera" or
  "video" icon will start up your default connected computer camera with a
  capture window.  To upload an existing image/video select the paper clip icon
  to browse for the file.

  ## Step Seven: Use the scratchpad to annotate images


  Press the new sheet button to launch a new scratchpad drawing sheet.

  There is a text box at the top for you to enter a title for the drawing sheet.


  On the top right are all the regular drawing tools:


  * Selector: Select any of your placed draw tools on the sheet so you can edit
  them at a later time.

  * Pen: Freehand pen for easy annotation

  * Text Entry: Add text to your draw sheet

  * Picture: Add images to your draw sheet


  When you select one of the drawing tools a selector box with that tool will be
  added to your sheet and more tool options will be added to the right side bar.


  When you are done with the sheet press the "Save" button to be returned to the
  previous screen.

  This button is visible in all tabs of the evaluation.  Choose the destination
  to save it to, enter the file name you would like to save it as and click
  save.
