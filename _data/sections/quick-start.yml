  This is a set of instructions covering the entire CRS workflow. These are not
  step by step instructions; more detailed instructions are provided later in
  the Detailed Usage sections.


  ## Step One: Create a new client


  From the Home View users can locate an existing client, or, choose to create a
  new client.

  ## Step Two: Create an evaluation


  At first view of a new client, there will be no evaluations in the evaluation
  screen. One must first be created with the New Evaluation button.

  ## Step Three: Add notes to the Basic Info section of the evaluation


  Each evaluation has several tabs worth of data (see tabs below header). On the
  Basic Info tab, users can set an external work order ID, and enter some
  general notes regarding the client.

  ## Step Four: Capture a Scan


  On the scanning tab, users can capture a new scan.

  When the scanner launches, a preview of the streaming 3D data will be
  displayed.  Use the controls at the right to position the bounding box around
  the target.  Press start to begin a scan.

  ## Step Five: Record Measurements


  Measurements can be taken within the scan by selecting "measure" and adding
  the chosen measurements or by navigating to the measurement tab of the
  evaluation. 


  In order to start a new measurement from the Measurement tab users press the
  "Add (Physical/Digital) measurement" button and a new screen will be displayed
  to enter this new measurement. 

  * Select from the drop down list to identify the measurement site.

  * If digital, select the scan to be used and measurement type.  Physical
  measurements should have the value typed into the text field. 

  * To interactively edit the measurement press the "Ruler" button. You will be
  given an option of "Point to Point" or "Orthographic" to choose which method
  you would like to measure with.



  "Point to Point" allows users to select points directly on the 3D model.
  "Orthographic" allows the user to select anywhere on the screen.


  Select a start point on the 3D model and then select an end point on the
  model. This will prompt 3 control points to show up along with a blue line
  going through them. Any of these points can be moved to allow more fine
  tuning.

  ## Step Six: Capture images and video


  On the Attachments tab upload images, video, and files to the evaluation by
  clicking on the corresponding icon.  Pressing the "camera" or "video" icon
  will start up the default connected computer camera with a capture window.  To
  upload an existing image/video select the paper clip icon to browse for the
  file.

  ## Step Seven: Use the scratchpad to annotate images


  Press the new sheet button to launch a new scratchpad drawing sheet.

  There is a text box at the top to enter a title for the drawing sheet.


  On the top right are all the regular drawing tools:


  * Selector: Select any of the placed draw tools on the sheet to be edited at a
  later time.

  * Pen: Freehand pen for easy annotation

  * Text Entry: Add text to the sheet

  * Picture: Add images to the sheet


  When one of the drawing tools is selected a selector box with that tool will
  be added to the sheet and more tool options will be added to the right side
  bar.


  When completed with the sheet press the "Save" button and the back arrow to be
  returned to the previous screen.

  ## Step Eight: Export the record to a PDF report


  The evaluation is saved as a PDF report by clicking the Save as PDF button. 
  This button is visible in all tabs of the evaluation.  Choose the destination
  to save it to, enter the desired file name and click save.
