content: "This is a set of instructions covering the entire CRS workflow. More detailed instructions with illustrations are provided later in the Detailed Usage sections.\n\n## Step One: Create a new client\n\nFrom the Home View you can locate an existing client, or choose to create a new client.\n\n![null](/uploads/01_a_homeview.JPG)\n\n## Step Two: Create an evaluation\n\nWhen you view a new client, there will be no evaluations in the evaluation screen. You must create one with the New Evaluation button.\n\n![null](/uploads/03_a_client_details.JPG)\n\n## Step Three: Add notes to the Basic Info section of the evaluation\n\nEach evaluation has several tabs worth of data (see tabs below header). On the Basic Info tab, you can set an external work order ID, and enter some general notes regarding the client.\n\n![null](/uploads/04_a_eval_view_basic_info.JPG)\n\n## Step Four: Capture a Scan\n\nOn the scanning tab, you can choose to capture a new scan.\n\n![null](/uploads/04_b_a_eval_view_scans.JPG)\n\nWhen the scanner launches, you'll see a preview of the streaming 3D data.  Use the controls at the right to position the bounding box around the target.  Press start to begin a scan.\n\n![](/uploads/10_a_scanner_preview.JPG)\n\nWhen complete press the Send button and the model will be saved.\n\n![](/uploads/10_c_scanner_review.JPG)\n\n\n\n## Step Five: Record Measurements\n\n{Measurements can be taken within the scan by selecting \"measure\" and adding the chosen measurements or by navigating to the measurement tab of the evaluation.} In order to start a new measurement you can press the \"Add measurement\" button and a new blank measurement will be added to your list. First Select the dropdown list to identify which measurement you plan on using. In order to interactively edit the measurement press the \"Ruler\" button. You will be given an option of \"Point to Point\" or \"Orthographic\" to choose which method you would like to measure with.\r\n\n\r\n\n\"Point to Point\" allows you to select points directly on the 3D model. \"Orthographic\" allows you to select anywhere on the screen.\r\n\n\r\n\nSelect a start point on the 3D model and then select an end point on the model. You should see 3 control points show up along with a red line going through them. You can grab any of these points to do more fine tuning.\n\n![](/uploads/08_c_scanning_measurement_point_to_point.JPG)\n\n\n\n## Step Six: Capture images and video\n\nOn the Attachments tab you can upload images, video, and files to the evaluation by clicking on the corresponding icon.  Pressing the \"camera\" or \"video\" icon will start up your default connected computer camera with a capture window.  To upload an existing image/video select the paper clip icon to browse for the file.\n\n![](/uploads/04_d_a_eval_view_attachments.JPG)\n\n\n\n## Step Seven: Use the scratchpad to annotate images\n\nPress the new sheet button to launch a new scratchpad drawing sheet.\n\n![](/uploads/04_e_a_eval_view_scratchpads.JPG)\n\nThere is a text box at the top for you to enter a title for the drawing sheet.\r\n\nOn the top right are all the regular drawing tools:\r\n\n* Selector: Select any of your placed draw tools on the sheet so you can edit them at a later time.\r\n* Pen: Freehand pen for easy annotation\r\n* Text Entry: Add text to your draw sheet\r\n* Picture: Add images to your draw sheet\r\n\nWhen you select one of the drawing tools a selector box with that tool will be added to your sheet and more tool options will be added to the right side bar.\r\n\nWhen you are done with the sheet press the \"Save\" button to be returned to the previous screen.\n\n![](/uploads/09_a_scratchpad.JPG)\n\n\n\n## Step Eight: Export the record to a PDF report"
