  ## Creating a New Client


  1. The app automatically opens to the home screen.  If you are starting from a
  different screen, go to the Home screen by clicking the house in the upper
  right menu panel.

  2. Click the large blue "create New Client +" button.

  3. Fill in client details and click Next.  <br> **Note:  If you do not enter a
  date of birth, the system will ask you to confirm you are leaving the date of
  birth set at the default date.**

  4. Review Client details and confirm creation or select to use an existing
  client.  The application will look for possible duplicates and notify of those
  it finds.
     <br> **Warning: Client details are final once created. **
  5. After confirmation you are taken directly to view the new client.


  ## Creating a New Evaluation


  1. Navigate to a client view by selecting your chosen client form the list of
  clients.  

  2. Click the blue "New Evaluation" button.  This creates a blank evaluation
  record. <br>Each evaluation has the following tabs:


  * Basic info
    * Optional Work Order ID
    * Optional notes
  * Scanning - launches the scanner and allows a new scan to be taken or the
  importing of completed scans previously taken and not saved to the evaluation

  * Measurements - view the existing scans, add new measurements to the
  evaluation

  * Attachments - capture images and video, attach files

  * Scratch pad - allows user to annotate images


  ## Capturing and Importing Scans


  When viewing a client evaluation, you can add multiple scans to the record. 
  These can be used for:


  * Capturing linear measurements electronically (e.g. seat depth)

  * Sending models to molding frame companies

  * Determining optimal tray cutout patterns


  To capture a scan and attach it to the evaluation, the following steps are
  required:


  1. Navigate to a client evaluation and click the scanning tab.

  2. Launch the scanning application by clicking New Scan.
     **Note: The RealSense sensor must be connected at this time.**
  3. Set the (white) bounty box to ensure your client is completely inside the
  scan using the Depth Distance and Box Scale controls on the right side of the
  screen.

  4.  Press the Start camera button on the left to start a streaming preview of
  the 3D data that will be formed into a 3D model.


  5. Slowly walk around the client, being careful to move the sensor up and down
  to capture a complete model. <br><br>Tips for Best Results: <br> Set the
  bounding box from 3-4 feet away; maintain this distance during the scan <br>
  Limit the use of other graphic intense programs during the scan <br> Ensure
  the sensor is aimed at the client and not blank space

  6. When satisfied with the model, press Complete Scan and save the file to
  your computer using the save dialog or press send to save the scan to the
  evaluation and return to the scanning tab.


  7. If you chose to save the scan to your computer you may now click Import
  Scan and navigate to the scan you just saved using the file dialog and import
  the scan to your evaluation.  The eyeball icon is used to view the scan.


  8. You should save the Evaluation now using the save button in the upper right
  corner.


  ## Orient a Scan Using the Set Views Controls


  After taking or importing a scan, **the first thing a user should do is to
  align the scan** so that the standard Top/Front/Left/etc views align
  correctly.  A scan can be aligned on the scanning tab using the **Set Views**
  controls.


  1. Go to a client screen, select an evaluation, go to the scanning tab.

  2. On the Scanning tab, select a scan and click the eyeball icon to view the
  scan. A new scan will not be oriented for top/left/right/etc until these views
  are configured.

  3. Manually rotate the model such that you are viewing it head on from the
  front.  Click **Edit** from the upper right controls and click **Set Front**. 
  <br> When you click any of these controls (e.g. Set Front) it will configure
  the model so the current view is locked as that view (e.g. front). Only one of
  the views needs to be set, and then all of the standard views will be
  calculated from there. <br> We recommend always starting with the front view,
  and fine tuning the other views if necessary.

  4. Once a view has been set, you should cycle through all of the views
  (front/left/right/etc) by clicking on them individually (Top,Left, etc.) and
  adjust alignment if necessary using first the **Edit** button then
  corresponding** Set** option.

  5. After the views are configured, you can collapse the Set Views controls by
  clicking the carrot above the controls.

  6. You should save the Evaluation now to ensure your configuration is saved.


  ## Taking Measurements


  On the Measurements tab, users can add electronic records of measurements to
  the Evaluation. Users may add as many measurements to the Evaluation as they
  want.


  1. Go to a client screen, select an Evaluation, and go to the Measurements
  tab.

  2. Click Add Physical Measurement or Add Digital Measurement to add a new
  measurement to the Evaluation. <br>**Note: Each measurement must have a
  measurement site selected (e.g. "Shoulder Width") using the provided drop down
  list.**

  3. If physical was selected, enter the measurement and click Save.  Each
  measurement must have a value before it can be saved.


  Measurement values can be entered by:


  Measuring the physical person, and entering the value into the text entry
  field.


  Clicking the blue ruler icon and taking the measurement from a scan.


  To capture a measurement from the scan, click the blue ruler icon. This will
  add two new controls to the viewer, allowing you to select from one of two
  measurement types:


  Orthographic -- the measurement will be projected onto the model from on of
  the 5 standard views (top/left/etc). These measurements are not bound directly
  to the model, but are snapped to the surface of a box surrounding the model.


  Point-to-Point -- this will measure on a straight line between any two points
  on the model.


  Both measurement types are taken by clicking two points on the viewer. Once
  both points have been placed, the measurement will populate the value of the
  corresponding measurement in the measurement list. Measurements can be edited
  after they are taken using the red control points in the 3D viewer.


  Note:


  * Measurements that have been entered manually can be edited using the text
  entry.

  * Measurements that have been taken from the scan may not be edited directly
  using the text field, but must be edited using control points in the scan
  viewer.

  * Measurements can be removed by clicking the small (-) symbol at the right
  side of the measurement.

  * Individual measurements can be viewed one at a time by clicking through the
  blue eyeball icons in the list of measurements.

  * If the measurement control points fall inside the model, the viewer will
  become transparent to ensure users can still edit the measurements.


  ## Capturing Images & Video/Attaching Files


  Video and images can be attached directly to evaluations on the Attachments
  tab. They are captured using the standard windows camera utilities and are
  automatically attached to the evaluation.


  * Cycle through the camera utilities (front camera, rear camera, etc.) by
  clicking the rotating camera image in the upper left corner.


  Images / Video that have already been captured can be viewed by selecting them
  from the list on the left.


  * Users have the option to type a description regarding the attached item in
  the bottom left corner after selecting it from the list.

  * Users may also choose to exclude them in PDF reports by switching the toggle
  (next to the description box) to the off position.  The system defaults to the
  on position.


  Images and videos have a preview screen; attaching other file types (ie PDF)
  will open in your default Windows viewer.


  ## Scratchpad


  1. Click New Sheet to create a new scratchpad sheet.


  2. Entering a title in the upper left corner is optional.


  3. Use the controls in the upper right corner to select a media type; some
  have additional options that will appear (i.e. pen color).


  4. Save the sheet to your evaluation by clicking the Save icon in the upper
  right corner.


  ## Generate PDF Reports


  Users can download the evaluation data as a PDF report by clicking the Save as
  PDF button when viewing an evaluation.
