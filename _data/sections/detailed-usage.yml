title: Detailed Usage
content: "## Creating a New Client\n\n1. Go to the Home screen by clicking the house in the upper right menu panel.\n2. Click the large blue \"create New Client +\" button.\n3. Fill in client details.  \n4. Review Client details and confirm creation or select to use an existing client.  The application will look for possible duplicates and notify of those it finds.\\\n   **Warning: Client details are final once created. **\n5. After confirmation you are taken directly to view the new client.\n\n## Creating a New Evaluation\n\n1. Navigate to a client view by selecting your chosen client form the list of clients.\n2. Click the blue \"New Evaluation\" button.  This creates a blank evaluation record.\n\nEach evaluation has the following tabs:\n\n* Basic info\n  * Optional Work Order ID\n  * Optional notes\n* Scanning - launches the scanner and allows a new scan to be taken or importing of completed scans previously taken and not saved to the evaluation\n* Measurements - view the existing scans, add new measurements to the evaluation\n* Attachments - capture images and video, attach files\n* Scratch pad - allows user to annotate images\n\n## Capturing and Importing Scans\n\nWhen viewing a client evaluation, you can add multiple scans to the record.  These can be used for:\n\n* Capturing linear measurements electronically (e.g. seat depth)\n* Sending models to molding frame companies\n* Determining optimal tray cutout patterns\n\nTo capture a scan and attach it to the evaluation, the following steps are required:\n\n1. Navigate to a client evaluation and click the scanning tab.\n2. Launch the scanning application by clicking New Scan.\n   **Note: The RealSense sensor must be connected at this time.**\n3. Press the Start camera button on the left to** **start a streaming preview of the 3D data.\n4. Press the Start scanning button on the right to start capturing a 3d model.\n5. Slowly walk around the client, being careful to move the sensor up and down to capture a complete model.\n6. When satisfied with the model, press Complete Scan and save the file to your computer using the save dialog.\n7. Close the scanning screen and return to to the scanning tab.  Click Import Scan.  Navigate to the scan you just saved using the file dialog and import the scan.\n\n## Orient a Scan Using the Set Views Controls\n\nAfter importing a scan, **the first thing a user should do is to align the scan** so that the standard Top/Front/Left/etc views align correctly.  A scan can be aligned on the scanning tab using the **Set Views** controls.\n\n1. Go to a client screen, select an evaluation, go to the scanning tab.\r\n2. On the Scanning tab, select a scan. A new scan will not be oriented for top/left/right/etc until the views are configured.\n3. Expand the **Configure Views** controls at bottom left.\r\n   \r\n   When you click any of these controls (e.g. Set Front) it will configure the model so the current view is locked as that view (e.g. front). Only one of the views needs to be set, and then all of the standard views will be calculated from there.\r\n   \r\n   We recommend starting with the front view, and fine tuning the other views if necessary.\r\n   \r\n   Manually rotate the model such that you are viewing it head on from the front and click **Set Front**.\n4. Once a view has been set, you should cycle through all of the views (front/left/right/etc) and adjust alignment if necessary.\r\n5. After the views are configured, you can collapse the Set Views controls by clicking done.\r\n6. You should save the Evaluation now to ensure your configuration is saved.\n\n## Taking Measurements\n\nOn the Measurements tab, users can add electronic records of measurements to the Evaluation. Users may add as many measurements to the Evaluation as they want.\r\n\n1. Go to a client screen, select an Evaluation, and go to the Measurements tab.\r\n2. Select a Scan.\r\n3. Click Add Measurement to add a new measurement to the Evaluation.\r  **Note: Each measurement must have a measurement site selected (e.g. \"Shoulder Width\") using the provided dropdown.**\n4. Each measurement must have a value before it can be saved.\r\n\nMeasurement values can be entered by:\r\n\nMeasuring the physical person, and entering the value into the text entry field.\r\n\nClicking the blue ruler icon and taking the measurement from a scan.\r\n\nTo capture a measurement from the scan, click the blue ruler icon. This will add two new controls to the viewer, allowing you to select from one of two measurement types:\r\n\nOrthographic -- the measurement will be projected onto the model from on of the 5 standard views (top/left/etc). These measurements are not bound directly to the model, but are snapped to the surface of a box surrounding the model.\r\n\nPoint-to-Point -- this will measure on a straight line between any two points on the model.\r\n\nBoth measurement types are taken by clicking two points on the viewer. Once both points have been placed, the measurement will populate the value of the corresponding measurement in the measurement list. Measurements can be edited after they are taken using the red control points in the 3D viewer.\n\nNote:\r\n\nMeasurements that have been entered manually can be edited using the text entry.\r\n\nMeasurements that have been taken from the scan may not be edited directly using the text field, but must be edited using control points in the scan viewer.\r\n\nMeasurements can be removed by clicking the small (-) symbol at the right side of the measurement.\r\n\nIndividual measurements can be viewed one at a time by clicking through the blue eyeball icons in the list of measurements.\r\n\nIf the measurement control points fall inside the model, the viewer will become transparent to ensure users can still edit the measurements.\n\n## Capturing Images & Video/Attaching Files\n\nVideo and images can be attached directly to evaluations on the Attachments tab. They are captured using the standard windows camera utilities, and are automatically attached to the evaluation.\r\n\nImages / Video that have already been captured can be viewed by selecting them in the dropdown.\n\nImages and videos have a preview screen; attaching other file types (ie PDF) will open in your default Windows viewer.\n\n## Generate PDF Reports\n\nUsers can download the evaluation data as a PDF report by clicking the Save as PDF button when viewing an evaluation."
