  The application automatically opens to the Client List (Home page) after
  logging in.  Users starting from a different screen in any of the below steps
  should navigate to the Client list by clicking the Home page icon in the upper
  right menu panel.


  ## Creating a New Client


  1. Click the large blue "create New Client +" button.

  2. Fill in client details and click Next.  <br> **Note:  If a date of birth is
  not entered, the system will ask confirmation to leave the date of birth set
  at the default date.**

  3. Review Client details and confirm creation by clicking "Create +" or select
  to use an existing client.  The application will look for possible duplicates
  and notify of those it finds.
     <br> **Warning: Client details are final once created. **
  4. After confirmation users are taken directly to view this new client.


  ## Creating a New Evaluation


  1. Navigate to a client view by selecting the chosen client from the list of
  clients.  

  2. Click the blue "New Evaluation" button.  This creates a blank evaluation
  record.

  3. Open an existing evaluation by selecting the evaluation from the list in
  the Evaluation tab. 


  <br>Each evaluation has the following tabs:


  * Clinical Evaluation - allows the user to enter sections of data such as
  contact information, home environments, skin integrity and more

  * Scanning - launches the scanner and allows a new scan to be taken or the
  user may import a completed scan previously taken that had not been saved to
  the evaluation

  * Measurements - view the existing scans, add new measurements to the
  evaluation

  * Attachments - capture images and video, attach files

  * Scratch pad - allows user to annotate images


  ## Capturing and Importing Scans


  When viewing a client evaluation, multiple scans can be added to the record. 
  These can be used for:


  * Capturing linear measurements electronically (e.g. seat depth)

  * Sending models to molding frame companies

  * Determining optimal tray cutout patterns


  To capture a scan and attach it to the evaluation, the following steps are
  required:


  1. Navigate to a client evaluation and click the Scanning tab.

  2. Launch the scanning application by clicking "New Scan".
     **Note: The RealSense sensor must be connected at this time.**
  3. A white dimensional box will appear that restricts the data included in the
  scan. This is referred to as the bounding box. 

  4. Set the bounding box to ensure the client is completely inside the scan
  using the Depth Distance and Box Scale controls on the right side of the
  screen.  Users should manually rotate the client on the screen (using device
  touch screen functionality or a mouse) and verify the client is within the
  bounding box.  Use the Depth Distance control to move the bounding box forward
  and backward. The Box Scale control is used to increase/decrease the size of
  the bounding box.  <br> <br> Tips for Best Results: <br> Set the bounding box
  from 3-4 feet away; maintain this distance during the scan <br>

  5. Press the red "Start" recording button on the right to start a streaming
  preview of the 3D data that will be formed into a 3D model.

  6. Slowly walk around the client, being careful to move the sensor up and down
  to capture a complete model. <br><br>Tips for Best Results: <br> Limit the use
  of other graphic intense programs during the scan <br> Ensure the sensor is
  aimed at the client and not blank space (br) Be careful to prevent abrupt
  movement of the sensor

  7. When satisfied with the model, press Complete Scan.  The data is now being
  formed into a 3D model and will appear on the device screen; this may take a
  few minutes.

  8. If desired, the scan may be cropped prior to saving.  When ready to save,
  press send in the upper right corner to save the scan to the evaluation and
  return to the scanning tab.  

  9. The eyeball icon is used to view the scan, if desired.

  10. Save the Evaluation now using the save button in the upper right corner.


  ## Orient a Scan Using the Set Views Controls


  After taking or importing a scan, **the first thing a user should do is to
  align the scan** so that the standard Top/Front/Left/etc. views align
  correctly.  A scan can be aligned on the scanning tab (within the scan view)
  using the **Set Views** controls.  Use the below steps:


  1. Navigate to a client evaluation and click the Scanning tab.

  2. On the Scanning tab, select a scan and click the eyeball icon to view the
  scan. A new scan will not be oriented for Top/Left/Right/etc. until these
  views are configured.

  3. Manually rotate the model on the screen such it is viewed head on from the
  front.  Click **Edit** from the upper left controls and click **Set Front**. 
  <br> When selecting any of these controls (e.g. Set Front) it will configure
  the model so the current view is locked as that view (e.g. front). Only one of
  the views needs to be set; the remaining standard views will be calculated
  from there. <br> CRS recommends always starting with the front view, and fine
  tuning the other views if necessary.

  4. Once a view has been set, cycle through all of the views
  (Front/Left/Right/etc.) by clicking on them individually (Top, Left, etc.) and
  adjust alignment if necessary using first the **Edit** button then
  corresponding **Set** option.

  5. After the views are configured, users can collapse the Set Views controls
  by clicking the carrot above the controls.  This is optional.

  6. Save the Evaluation now using the Save button in the upper right corner to
  ensure the configuration is saved.

  7. Click the back arrow to return to the scanning tab.


  ## Taking Measurements


  On the Measurements tab, users can add electronic records of measurements to
  the Evaluation. Users may add as many measurements to the Evaluation as they
  want. Users have the option to have digital measurements added (from an
  existing scan) or to enter measurements that have previously been taken. 


  Measurement values can be entered by:


  * Using the Add buttons above the default measurement list.

  * Within a scan by clicking Measure button in the upper right corner and then
  the blue ruler icon and taking the measurement from within a scan using one of
  the three available measurement modes.


  1. Navigate to a client evaluation and click the Measurements tab.

  2. A default list of measurements will auto-populate.  These measurements can
  be edited (or taken) by clicking the pencil icon.  This default list can be
  modified in user settings.

  3. To add a measurement, click Add Physical Measurement or Add Digital
  Measurement to add a new measurement to the Evaluation. <br>**Note: Each
  measurement must have a measurement site selected (e.g. "Shoulder Width")
  using the provided drop down list.** <br> Users may switch from physical
  measurement mode to digital by clicking the Physical or Digital tab within the
  Add New Measurement Screen.

  4. If physical was selected, enter the measurement and click Save.  Each
  measurement must have a value before it can be saved.

  5. If digital was selected, users must also select the desired scan the
  measurement should be taken from.  Then select the measurement mode and click
  measure.


  To capture a measurement from the scan, navigate to a scan by clicking the
  eyeball icon on the desired scan, then clicking the measure button in the
  upper right and click the blue ruler icon. This will prompt a list dialog to
  the viewer, allowing you to select from a measurement type:


  * Point-to-Point -- this will measure on a straight line between any two
  points on the model.   Users should place the start and end point of the
  measurement on the model after selecting this measurement mode.  Point to
  point measurement mode should be used when taking measurements of clients with
  asymmetry for accuracy; this measurement is bound directly to the model. 

  * Orthographic -- the measurement will be projected onto the model from one of
  the 5 standard views (Top/Left/etc.). These measurements are not bound
  directly to the model and are instead snapped to the surface of a box
  surrounding the model.

  * Physical -- this measurement mode allows you to measure the physical person
  and enter the value into the text entry field.


  Both point-to-point and orthographic measurement types are taken by clicking
  two points on the viewer. Once both points have been placed, the measurement
  will populate the value of the corresponding measurement in the measurement
  list. These are both digital measurements and can be edited after taken using
  first the blue view button and then modifying the blue control points in the
  3D viewer.


  Note:


  * Measurements that have been entered manually can be edited using the text
  entry.

  * Measurements that have been taken from the scan may not be edited directly
  using the text field; these must be edited using control points in the scan
  viewer.

  * Measurements can be removed by clicking the small (-) symbol at the right
  side of the measurement within scan view or the delete button on the
  Measurement tab.

  * Individual digital measurements can be viewed one at a time by clicking
  through the blue view icons in the list of measurements.

  * If the measurement control points fall inside the model, the viewer will
  become transparent to ensure users can still edit the measurements.

  * After clicking **Save** to save the measurements, use the back arrow on the
  upper left corner to go back to the Measurements tab.


  ## Capturing Images & Video/Attaching Files


  Video and images can be attached directly to evaluations on the Attachments
  tab. They are captured using the standard windows camera utilities and are
  automatically attached to the evaluation.


  1. Navigate to a client evaluation and click the Attachments tab.

  2. Select the desired media to attach (e.g. photo, video, etc.).

  3. When choosing photo or video, cycle through the camera utilities (front
  camera, rear camera, etc.) by clicking the rotating camera image in the upper
  left corner.

  4. For photo, click the camera icon to take a picture and then "Done" to save
  the new image to the Attachments tab.  Video uses the start/end record buttons
  then "Ok" to save.


  Note:


  * Images / Video that have already been captured can be viewed by selecting
  them from the list on the left.

  * Images and videos have a preview screen; attaching other file types (e.g.
  PDF) will open in the device default Windows viewer.

  * Users have the option to type a description regarding the attached item in
  the bottom right corner after selecting it from the list.

  * Users may also choose to exclude attachments in PDF reports by switching the
  toggle (next to the description box) to the off position.  The system defaults
  to the on position.
    Click save to update.

  ## Scratchpad


  1. Navigate to a client evaluation and click the Scratch Pad tab.

  2. Click New Sheet to create a new scratch pad sheet.

  3. Entering a title in the upper left corner is optional.

  4. Use the controls in the upper right corner to select a media type; some
  have additional options that will appear (e.g. pen color).

  5. Save the sheet to the evaluation by clicking the Save icon in the upper
  right corner.

  6. Click the back arrow to go back to the scratch pad tab after saving.


  ## Generate PDF Reports


  Users can download the evaluation data as a PDF report by clicking the Save as
  PDF button when viewing an evaluation.  The system will prompt a title
  indicating a portion of the Client's name and the date of the evaluation.
