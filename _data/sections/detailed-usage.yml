  record.


  Each evaluation has the following tabs:

  importing of completed scans previously taken and not saved to the evaluation

  evaluation

  * Scratch pad - allows user to annotate images

  When viewing a client evaluation, you can add multiple scans to the record. 
  These can be used for:


  * Capturing linear measurements electronically (e.g. seat depth)

  * Sending models to molding frame companies

  To capture a scan and attach it to the evaluation, the following steps are
  required:


  1. Navigate to a client evaluation and click the scanning tab.
